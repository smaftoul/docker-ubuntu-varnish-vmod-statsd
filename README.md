varnish vmod builder
====================

Execute `./run` to build vmod statsd for varnish 4.
Build output will bin in `./vmod`.

The vmod is built for ubuntu 14.04 with varnish own apt source (which install varnish4).

The upstream vmod is for varnish3 but this repo builds an opened PR which makes it work for varnish4.
